CSS Considerations

Frameworks and libraries are not allowed. The assignment requires you to create a responsive layout for all screen widths from (320px) and up. For this class, you may use a normalize CSS file. The class requires you to use a small.css followed by a larger.css file. The larger css file must contain a media query.

JS

Add multiple JavaScript files as needed. For example, create files to support the responsive navigation (navigation.js), dates (date.js), and course information cards (course.js). Reference these in the head using the defer attribute method. As you move through this course, you will need to add additional JS files. Only load the files for each page that are needed for that page.
